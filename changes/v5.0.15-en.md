# v5.0.15

## Enhancements

- [#9569](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9569) Refactor `/authorization/sources/built_in_database/` by adding `rules/` to the path.

- [#9585](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9585) `/bridges_probe` API endpoint to test params for creating a new data bridge.

- [#9586](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9586) Basic auth is no longer allowed for API calls, must use API key instead.

- [#9628](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9628) Expose additional resource configuration parameters: `start_after_created` and `start_timeout`.

- [#9722](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9722) Add the following configuration options for Pushing metrics to Prometheus Push Gateway:
  - `headers`: Allows custom HTTP request headers.
  - `job_name`: allows to customize the name of the Job pushed to Push Gateway.

- [#9725](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9725) Remove the config `auto_reconnect` from the emqx_authz, emqx_authn and data-bridge componets.
  This is because we have another config with similar functions: `resource_opts.auto_restart_interval`ã€‚

  The functions of these two config are difficult to distinguish, which will lead to confusion.
  After this change, `auto_reconnect` will not be configurable (always be true), and the underlying
  drivers that support this config will automatically reconnect the abnormally disconnected
  connection every `2s`.

  And the config `resource_opts.auto_restart_interval` is still available for user.
  It is the time interval that emqx restarts the resource when the connection cannot be
  established for some reason.

- [#9736](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9736) Refactor of /bridges API to make it more consistent with other APIs:
  - bridge enable/disable is now done via the endpoint `/bridges/{id}/enable/[true,false]`
  - `/bridges/{id}/operation/{operation}` endpoints are now `/bridges/{id}/{operation}`
  - metrics are moved out from the GET `/bridges/{id}` response and can now be fetched via `/bridges/{id}/metrics`
  - the `bridges/{id}/reset_metrics` endpoint is now `/bridges/{id}/metrics/reset`

- [#9774](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9774) Add a password complexity requirement when adding or modifying Dashboard users via the API.
  Now password must contain at least 2 of alphabetic, numeric and special characters,
  and must be 8 to 64 characters long.

## Bug fixes

- [#9626](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9626) Return authorization settings with default values.
  The authorization cache is enabled by default, but due to the missing default value in `GET` response of `/authorization/settings`, it seemed to be disabled from the dashboard.

- [#9680](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9680) Fix the problem that username and password authentication is mandatory in Influxdb v1 write API.

- [#9726](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9726) Client fuzzy search API results were missing information which could tell if more results are available in the next pages, this is now fixed by providing `hasnext` flag in the response.

- [#9735](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9735) Password information has been removed from information log messages for http, ldap, mongo, mqtt, mysql, pgsql and redis.

- [#9748](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9748) Listeners not configured with `max_connections` will cause the cluster `/listeners` API to return 500 error.

- [#9749](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9749) In some cases search APIs could respond with an incorrect `count` value in the metadata, that is usually much bigger than expected, this is now fixed.

- [#9750](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9750) Reload overriding configs after boot.
  Prior to this change, two configs were allow to change from dashboard, but will not take effect after reboot:
  * Logging (such as level)
  * Prometheus configs


- [#9751](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9751) Fix that obsoleted cert file will not be deleted after the listener is updated/deleted

- [#9763](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9763) Fix an authentication exception when password is not provided

- [#9765](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9765) Parse decimals as password from environment variable overrides correctly.
  Prior to this change, config values for passwords are not allowed to be decimals.
  e.g. `EMQX_FOOBAR__PASSWORD=12344` or `emqx.foobar.password=1234`
  would result in a type check error, unless quoted as:
  `EMQX_FOOBAR__PASSWORD='"12344"'` or `emqx.foobar.password="1234"`.
  After this fix, the value does not have to be quoted.

- [#9769](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9769) Fix Erlang shell prompt version prefix. e5.0.15 -> v5.0.15

- [#9780](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9780) When creating disk queue directory for resource worker, substitute ':' with '-' in worker id.

- [#9781](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9781) Trace files were left on a node when creating a zip file for download. They are now removed when the file is sent. Also, concurrent downloads will no longer interfere with each other.

- [#9785](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9785) Stop authentication hook chain if `emqx_authn_chains` provides a definitive result.

- [#9787](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9787) Fix a compatible problem for the `webhook` bridge configuration which was created before the v5.0.12.
